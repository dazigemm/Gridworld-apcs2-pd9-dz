1. What is the role of the instance variable sideLength?
	It serves as the sidelength for the box, the BoxBug creates.
2. What is the role of the instance variable steps?
	Instance variable steps, is the amount of steps the BoxBug has taken along the side of the box.
3. Why is the turn method called twice when steps becomes equal to
sideLength?
	Turn is called twice because of each call to turn turns the BoxBug 45 degrees and we would like it to turn 90.
4. Why can the move method be called in the BoxBug class when there is no
move method in the BoxBug code?
	BoxBug extends Bug, which DOES have a move method.
5. After a BoxBug is constructed, will the size of its square pattern always be the
same? Why or why not?
	No it will not.  If there is a wall in the way, it will turn at the wall, leaving its box the wrong side length.
6. Can the path a BoxBug travels ever change? Why or why not?
	Yes it can.  For example, if the BoxBug runs into an obstacle, its path will change.
7. When will the value of steps be zero?
	The value of steps will be zero when the BoxBug is instantiated, and right after it has made a turn.
